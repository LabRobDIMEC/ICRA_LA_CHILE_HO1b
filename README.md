# Planetary gear reducer design design and control for Quadruped Robot.

Instructor: [Ulises Campod√≥nico](https://github.com/uwulises)

The workshop addresses the design, calculation, assembly, and closed-loop control of a planetary gearbox to amplify BLDC motor torque. The workshop will cover parts identification, actuator assembly, and closed-loop commissioning using the SimpleFOC Arduino library.

## Design aspects for our perrito quadruped robot

This project was born in early 2024 at the [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://dimec.uchile.cl/) by Design of Mechanical Systems students.
